    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Walport family settled in the Applegate Valley after the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused a fire destroying their home, but leaving the family uninjured.</p>
    <p>Bruce and Judy started their journey here with cattle, and after several years, their son Eric left for college. The cattle were sold, and the land rested.</p>
    <p>Upon returning home to the Applegate, Eric and his wife Amy purchased their home next door, and started their journey to transform the retired cattle ranch into a vineyard.</p>
