    <h2>Wine Selection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Sauvignon Blanc 2018</h3>
        <p>$27</p>
        <p>After fermentation, we barreled 1/3 of this Sauvignon Blanc in new American oak for 2 months and then blended it back with its unoaked counterparts yielding a wonderfully balanced wine. The oak, coupled with short duration aging, provides this Sauvignon Blanc with delicate notes of toasted coconut and a creamy mouthfeel. The resulting subtle complexity still fully expresses all of the unique varietal characteristics of grapefruit, peach, and rose petal aroma.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Merlot 2014</h3>
        <p>$33</p>
        <p>From the fine lineage of Cabernet Franc, and a half-sibling to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot continues to be a widely produced and valued varietal of the French wine-making legacy. This merlot provides a delicate ruby color with cherry, plum, and cassis aromas. Soft lingering tannins with a satin mouthfeel provide structure to the dark stone fruit and tobacco flavors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cabernet Sauvignon 2014</h3>
        <p>$37</p>
        <p>An offspring of Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon endows its rich, French ancestry to the wine selection at Walport Family Cellars. Deeper in color and more robust in flavor than either parent, Cabernet Sauvignon stands boldly as a dominant single varietal, contributes both structure and flavor to blends, and has exceptional aging ability. Aromas of tart cherry, leather, and blackberries. Muscular and round tannins follow the smoky flavors of dark bramble fruits, herbs, and leather.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Syrah 2015</h3>
        <p>$34</p>
        <p>Bronze Medal winner!! While a distant relative to our other offerings, Syrah has a more direct familial linkage to the great Pinot-derived wines of France. Syrah is used frequently in the sumptuous blends of the Rhône Valley, making an earthy contribution to Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Côtes du Rhône. A complex nose of sweet black pepper, sage, and black currant follows through to the palate with a sumptuous velvety mouthfeel followed by full & structured tannins.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Syrah 2016</h3>
        <p>$33</p>
        <p>Stunning dark purple coloration with aromatics of leather, tobacco, and plum. Moderate tannins combined with flavors of tart cherry, plum, and tobacco provide great flavor to this wine.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Twisted Vines Red Blend 2016</h3>
        <p>$35</p>
        <p>DOUBLE GOLD MEDAL Twisted vines is an unorthodox blend of 50% Syrah, 25% Merlot, and 25% Pinot Noir. The large and bold tannins of the Syrah give way to the softer and more elegant structure of the Merlot and Pinot Noir that results in a full-bodied yet sophisticated and complex wine. Notes of plum and blackberry follow through with vibrant colors and robust flavors of dark stone fruits and tart cherries.</p>
