***About Us***

The Walport family settled in the Applegate Valley after the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused a fire destroying their home, but leaving the family uninjured.

Bruce and Judy started their journey here with cattle, and after several years, their son Eric left for college.  The cattle were sold, and the land rested.  

Upon returning home to the Applegate, Eric and his wife Amy purchased their home next door, and started their journey to transform the retired cattle ranch into a vineyard.

***Wine Selection***

Sauvignon Blanc 2018  $27
After fermentation, we barreled 1/3 of this Sauvignon Blanc in new American oak for 2 months and then blended it back with it's unoaked counterparts yielding a wonderfully balanced wine.  The oak, coupled with short duration aging, provides this Sauvignon Blanc with delicate notes of toasted coconut and a creamy mouth feel.  The resulting subtle complexity still fully expresses all of the unique varietal characteristics of grapefruit, peach, and rose petal aroma.

Merlot 2014  $33
From the fine lineage of Cabernet Franc, and a half-sibling to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot continues to be a widely produced and valued varietal of the French wine-making legacy. This merlot provides a delicate ruby color with cherry, plum and cassis aromas.  Soft lingering tannins with a satin mouthfeel provide structure to the dark stone fruit and tobacco flavors.

Cabernet Sauvignon 2014  $37
An offspring of Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon endows its rich, French ancestry to the wine selection at Walport Family Cellars.

Deeper in color and more robust in flavor than either parent, Cabernet Sauvignon stands boldly as a dominant single varietal, contributes both structure and flavor to blends and has exceptional aging ability.  Aromas of tart cherry, leather and black berries.  Muscular and round tannins follow the smokey flavors of dark bramble fruits, herbs and leather.

Syrah 2015  $34
Bronze Medal winner!!
While a distant relative to our other offerings, Syrah has a more direct familial linkage to the great Pinot-derived wines of France. Syrah is used frequently in the sumptuous blends of the Rhône Valley, making an earthy contribution to Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Côtes du Rhône.  A complex nose of sweet black pepper, sage and black currant follows through to the pallet with a sumptuous velvety mouthfeel followed by full & structured tannins.

Syrah 2016  $33
Stunning dark purple coloration with aromatics of leather, tobacco and plum. Moderate tannins combined with flavors of tart cherry, plum and tobacco provide great flavor to this wine.

Twisted Vines Red Blend 2016  $35
DOUBLE GOLD MEDAL 
Twisted vines is an unorthodox blend of 50% Syrah, 25% Merlot, and 25% Pinot Noir.  The large and bold tannins of the Syrah give way to the softer and more elegant structure of the Merlot and Pinot Noir that results in a full-bodied yet sophisticated and complex wine. Notes of plum and blackberry follow through with vibrant colors and robust flavors of dark stone fruits and tart cherries.

The Earth’s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees and, as a result, the plane of the equator is tilted with respect to the plane of our orbit around the Sun.  This gives rise to the seasons which provide the essential annual changes needed to produce wine.
 
The Vernal and Autumnal equinox along with the Winter and Summer Solstice allows Walport Family Cellars the opportunity to appreciate and celebrate the contribution of each season with the release of new wine!
